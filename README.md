# LearnOpenGL-Python
Tutorials from [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/OpenGL) translated to Python using PyOpenGL & pyGLFW.

As there is a lack of tutorials covering OpenGL-development with Python I am trying to translate the very good existing tutorials from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) written in C++ into Python.

## Requirements

- PyOpenGL ([documentation](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/))
- pyGLFW ([github](https://github.com/FlorianRhiem/pyGLFW))
- numpy

Simply install the packages using pip or conda using `pip install PyOpenGL glfw numpy`.

## Notes
- I am still in the phase of learning, so happy to receive improvement proposals.
- The original tutorials and C++ code were written by [Joey de Vries](https://learnopengl.com/About). I am in no way affiliated to him.
  - The original code samples were published under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license (see [description](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)).
- Major changes in the code structure/ commands have been marked with `INFO: xxx`.

## Status
- [ ] Tutorial 1 "OpenGL"
- [ ] Tutorial 2 "Creating a Window"
- [X] Tutorial 3 "Hello Window"
- [X] Tutorial 4 "Hello Triangle"
