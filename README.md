# LearnOpenGL-Python
Tutorials from [Learn OpenGL](learnopengl.com) translated to Python using PyOpenGL & pyGLFW.

As there is a lack of tutorials covering OpenGL-development with Python I am trying to translate the very good existing tutorials from learnopengl.com written in C++ into Python.

## Requirements

- PyOpenGL ([documentation](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/))
- pyGLFW ([github](https://github.com/FlorianRhiem/pyGLFW))
- numpy

Simply install the packages using pip or conda using `pip install PyOpenGL glfw numpy`.

## Notes
- I am still in the phase of learning, so happy to receive improvement proposals.
- The original tutorials and C++ code were written by [Joey de Vries](https://learnopengl.com/About). I am in no way affiliated to him.
  - The original code samples were published under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license (see [description](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)).

## Status
